,Biology,"A Comprehensive Survey of Continual Learning: Theory, Method and Application","To cope with real-world dynamics, an intelligent system needs to incrementally acquire, update, accumulate, and exploit knowledge throughout its lifetime. This ability, known as continual learning, provides a foundation for AI systems to develop themselves adaptively. In a general sense, continual learning is explicitly limited by catastrophic forgetting, where learning a new task usually results in a dramatic performance drop of the old tasks. Beyond this, increasingly numerous advances have emerged in recent years that largely extend the understanding and application of continual learning. The growing and widespread interest in this direction demonstrates its realistic significance as well as complexity. In this work, we present a comprehensive survey of continual learning, seeking to bridge the basic settings, theoretical foundations, representative methods, and practical applications. Based on existing theoretical and empirical results, we summarize the general objectives of continual learning as ensuring a proper stability-plasticity trade-off and an adequate intra/inter-task generalizability in the context of resource efficiency. Then we provide a state-of-the-art and elaborated taxonomy, extensively analyzing how representative strategies address continual learning, and how they are adapted to particular challenges in various applications. Through an in-depth discussion of promising directions, we believe that such a holistic perspective can greatly facilitate subsequent exploration in this field and beyond.",['continual learning']
,Medicine,Discovering biomarkers associated and predicting cardiovascular disease with high accuracy using a novel nexus of machine learning techniques for precision medicine,"Abstract Personalized interventions are deemed vital given the intricate characteristics, advancement, inherent genetic composition, and diversity of cardiovascular diseases (CVDs). The appropriate utilization of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) methodologies can yield novel understandings of CVDs, enabling improved personalized treatments through predictive analysis and deep phenotyping. In this study, we proposed and employed a novel approach combining traditional statistics and a nexus of cutting-edge AI/ML techniques to identify significant biomarkers for our predictive engine by analyzing the complete transcriptome of CVD patients. After robust gene expression data pre-processing, we utilized three statistical tests (Pearson correlation, Chi-square test, and ANOVA) to assess the differences in transcriptomic expression and clinical characteristics between healthy individuals and CVD patients. Next, the recursive feature elimination classifier assigned rankings to transcriptomic features based on their relation to the case–control variable. The top ten percent of commonly observed significant biomarkers were evaluated using four unique ML classifiers (Random Forest, Support Vector Machine, Xtreme Gradient Boosting Decision Trees, and k-Nearest Neighbors). After optimizing hyperparameters, the ensembled models, which were implemented using a soft voting classifier, accurately differentiated between patients and healthy individuals. We have uncovered 18 transcriptomic biomarkers that are highly significant in the CVD population that were used to predict disease with up to 96% accuracy. Additionally, we cross-validated our results with clinical records collected from patients in our cohort. The identified biomarkers served as potential indicators for early detection of CVDs. With its successful implementation, our newly developed predictive engine provides a valuable framework for identifying patients with CVDs based on their biomarker profiles.","['Random Forest', 'Support Vector Machine', 'Xtreme Gradient Boosting Decision Trees', 'k-Nearest Neighbors', 'soft voting classifier']"
,Medicine,Improving large language models for clinical named entity recognition via prompt engineering,"Abstract Importance The study highlights the potential of large language models, specifically GPT-3.5 and GPT-4, in processing complex clinical data and extracting meaningful information with minimal training data. By developing and refining prompt-based strategies, we can significantly enhance the models’ performance, making them viable tools for clinical NER tasks and possibly reducing the reliance on extensive annotated datasets. Objectives This study quantifies the capabilities of GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 for clinical named entity recognition (NER) tasks and proposes task-specific prompts to improve their performance. Materials and Methods We evaluated these models on 2 clinical NER tasks: (1) to extract medical problems, treatments, and tests from clinical notes in the MTSamples corpus, following the 2010 i2b2 concept extraction shared task, and (2) to identify nervous system disorder-related adverse events from safety reports in the vaccine adverse event reporting system (VAERS). To improve the GPT models' performance, we developed a clinical task-specific prompt framework that includes (1) baseline prompts with task description and format specification, (2) annotation guideline-based prompts, (3) error analysis-based instructions, and (4) annotated samples for few-shot learning. We assessed each prompt's effectiveness and compared the models to BioClinicalBERT. Results Using baseline prompts, GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 achieved relaxed F1 scores of 0.634, 0.804 for MTSamples and 0.301, 0.593 for VAERS. Additional prompt components consistently improved model performance. When all 4 components were used, GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 achieved relaxed F1 socres of 0.794, 0.861 for MTSamples and 0.676, 0.736 for VAERS, demonstrating the effectiveness of our prompt framework. Although these results trail BioClinicalBERT (F1 of 0.901 for the MTSamples dataset and 0.802 for the VAERS), it is very promising considering few training samples are needed. Discussion The study’s findings suggest a promising direction in leveraging LLMs for clinical NER tasks. However, while the performance of GPT models improved with task-specific prompts, there's a need for further development and refinement. LLMs like GPT-4 show potential in achieving close performance to state-of-the-art models like BioClinicalBERT, but they still require careful prompt engineering and understanding of task-specific knowledge. The study also underscores the importance of evaluation schemas that accurately reflect the capabilities and performance of LLMs in clinical settings. Conclusion While direct application of GPT models to clinical NER tasks falls short of optimal performance, our task-specific prompt framework, incorporating medical knowledge and training samples, significantly enhances GPT models' feasibility for potential clinical applications.","['few-shot learning', 'BioClinicalBERT']"
,Engineering,The diagnostic and triage accuracy of the GPT-3 artificial intelligence model: an observational study,"BackgroundArtificial intelligence (AI) applications in health care have been effective in many areas of medicine, but they are often trained for a single task using labelled data, making deployment and generalisability challenging. How well a general-purpose AI language model performs diagnosis and triage relative to physicians and laypeople is not well understood.MethodsWe compared the predictive accuracy of Generative Pre-trained Transformer 3 (GPT-3)'s diagnostic and triage ability for 48 validated synthetic case vignettes (<50 words; sixth-grade reading level or below) of both common (eg, viral illness) and severe (eg, heart attack) conditions to a nationally representative sample of 5000 lay people from the USA who could use the internet to find the correct options and 21 practising physicians at Harvard Medical School. There were 12 vignettes for each of four triage categories: emergent, within one day, within 1 week, and self-care. The correct diagnosis and triage category (ie, ground truth) for each vignette was determined by two general internists at Harvard Medical School. For each vignette, human respondents and GPT-3 were prompted to list diagnoses in order of likelihood, and the vignette was marked as correct if the ground-truth diagnosis was in the top three of the listed diagnoses. For triage accuracy, we examined whether the human respondents' and GPT-3's selected triage was exactly correct according to the four triage categories, or matched a dichotomised triage variable (emergent or within 1 day vs within 1 week or self-care). We estimated GPT-3's diagnostic and triage confidence on a given vignette using a modified bootstrap resampling procedure, and examined how well calibrated GPT-3's confidence was by computing calibration curves and Brier scores. We also performed subgroup analysis by case acuity, and an error analysis for triage advice to characterise how its advice might affect patients using this tool to decide if they should seek medical care immediately.FindingsAmong all cases, GPT-3 replied with the correct diagnosis in its top three for 88% (42/48, 95% CI 75–94) of cases, compared with 54% (2700/5000, 53–55) for lay individuals (p<0.0001) and 96% (637/666, 94–97) for physicians (p=0·012). GPT-3 triaged 70% correct (34/48, 57–82) versus 74% (3706/5000, 73–75; p=0.60) for lay individuals and 91% (608/666, 89–93%; p<0.0001) for physicians. As measured by the Brier score, GPT-3 confidence in its top prediction was reasonably well calibrated for diagnosis (Brier score=0·18) and triage (Brier score=0·22). We observed an inverse relationship between case acuity and GPT-3 accuracy (p<0·0001) with a fitted trend line of –8·33% decrease in accuracy for every level of increase in case acuity. For triage error analysis, GPT-3 deprioritised truly emergent cases in seven instances.InterpretationA general-purpose AI language model without any content-specific training could perform diagnosis at levels close to, but below, physicians and better than lay individuals. We found that GPT-3's performance was inferior to physicians for triage, sometimes by a large margin, and its performance was closer to that of lay individuals. Although the diagnostic performance of GPT-3 was comparable to physicians, it was significantly better than a typical person using a search engine.FundingThe National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute.",['Generative Pre-trained Transformer 3 (GPT-3)']
,Engineering,Deep Learning for Integrated Origin–Destination Estimation and Traffic Sensor Location Problems,"Traffic control and management applications require the full realization of traffic flow data. Frequently, such data are acquired by traffic sensors with two issues: it is not practicable or even possible to place traffic sensors on every link in a network; sensors do not provide direct information about origin–destination (O–D) demand flows. Therefore, it is imperative to locate the best places to deploy traffic sensors and then augment the knowledge obtained from this link flow sample to predict the entire traffic flow of the network. This article provides a resilient deep learning (DL) architecture combined with a global sensitivity analysis tool to solve O–D estimation and sensor location problems simultaneously. The proposed DL architecture is based on the stacked sparse autoencoder (SAE) model for accurately estimating the entire O–D flows of the network using link flows, thus reversing the conventional traffic assignment problem. The SAE model extracts traffic flow characteristics and derives a meaningful relationship between traffic flow data and network topology. To train the proposed DL architecture, synthetic link flow data were created randomly from the historical demand data of the network. Finally, a global sensitivity analysis was implemented to prioritize the importance of each link in the O–D estimation step to solve the sensor location problem. Two networks of different sizes were used to validate the performance of the model. The efficiency of the proposed method for solving the combination of traffic flow estimation and sensor location problems was confirmed from a low root-mean-square error with a reduction in the number of link flows required.",['stacked sparse autoencoder (SAE) model']
,Engineering,Evaluation of artificial intelligence-powered screening for sexually transmitted infections-related skin lesions using clinical images and metadata,"Abstract Background Sexually transmitted infections (STIs) pose a significant global public health challenge. Early diagnosis and treatment reduce STI transmission, but rely on recognising symptoms and care-seeking behaviour of the individual. Digital health software that distinguishes STI skin conditions could improve health-seeking behaviour. We developed and evaluated a deep learning model to differentiate STIs from non-STIs based on clinical images and symptoms. Methods We used 4913 clinical images of genital lesions and metadata from the Melbourne Sexual Health Centre collected during 2010–2023. We developed two binary classification models to distinguish STIs from non-STIs: (1) a convolutional neural network (CNN) using images only and (2) an integrated model combining both CNN and fully connected neural network (FCN) using images and metadata. We evaluated the model performance by the area under the ROC curve (AUC) and assessed metadata contributions to the Image-only model. Results Our study included 1583 STI and 3330 non-STI images. Common STI diagnoses were syphilis (34.6%), genital warts (24.5%) and herpes (19.4%), while most non-STIs (80.3%) were conditions such as dermatitis, lichen sclerosis and balanitis. In both STI and non-STI groups, the most frequently observed groups were 25–34 years (48.6% and 38.2%, respectively) and heterosexual males (60.3% and 45.9%, respectively). The Image-only model showed a reasonable performance with an AUC of 0.859 (SD 0.013). The Image + Metadata model achieved a significantly higher AUC of 0.893 (SD 0.018) compared to the Image-only model ( p &lt; 0.01). Out of 21 metadata, the integration of demographic and dermatological metadata led to the most significant improvement in model performance, increasing AUC by 6.7% compared to the baseline Image-only model. Conclusions The Image + Metadata model outperformed the Image-only model in distinguishing STIs from other skin conditions. Using it as a screening tool in a clinical setting may require further development and evaluation with larger datasets.","['convolutional neural network (CNN)', 'fully connected neural network (FCN)']"
,Social Sciences,Systematic literature review: Quantum machine learning and its applications,"Quantum physics has changed the way we understand our environment, and one of its branches, quantum mechanics, has demonstrated accurate and consistent theoretical results. Quantum computing is the process of performing calculations using quantum mechanics. This field studies the quantum behavior of certain subatomic particles (photons, electrons, etc.) for subsequent use in performing calculations, as well as for large-scale information processing. These advantages are achieved through the use of quantum features, such as entanglement or superposition. These capabilities can give quantum computers an advantage in terms of computational time and cost over classical computers. Nowadays, scientific challenges are impossible to perform by classical computation due to computational complexity (more bytes than atoms in the observable universe) or the time it would take (thousands of years), and quantum computation is the only known answer. However, current quantum devices do not have yet the necessary qubits and are not fault-tolerant enough to achieve these goals. Nonetheless, there are other fields like machine learning, finance, or chemistry where quantum computation could be useful with current quantum devices. This manuscript aims to present a review of the literature published between 2017 and 2023 to identify, analyze, and classify the different types of algorithms used in quantum machine learning and their applications. The methodology follows the guidelines related to Systematic Literature Review methods, such as the one proposed by Kitchenham and other authors in the software engineering field. Consequently, this study identified 94 articles that used quantum machine learning techniques and algorithms and shows their implementation using computational quantum circuits or ansatzs. The main types of found algorithms are quantum implementations of classical machine learning algorithms, such as support vector machines or the k-nearest neighbor model, and classical deep learning algorithms, like quantum neural networks. One of the most relevant applications in the machine learning field is image classification. Many articles, especially within the classification, try to solve problems currently answered by classical machine learning but using quantum devices and algorithms. Even though results are promising, quantum machine learning is far from achieving its full potential. An improvement in quantum hardware is required for this potential to be achieved since the existing quantum computers lack enough quality, speed, and scale to allow quantum computing to achieve its full potential.","['support vector machines', 'k-nearest neighbor model', 'quantum neural networks']"
